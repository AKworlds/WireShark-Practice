# 📝 Exercise 2: Sus file

## 📌 Overview
This analysis documents a security incident involvng a malicious file downloaded through a fake Google Authenticator advertisemnet campaign.

## 📊 Key Objectives
- Identify infected Windows client IP address, MAC address, and hostname
- Determine user account involved in the incident
- Analyze packet capture data to identify C2 infrastructure
- Document malicious domain names associated with fake Google Authenticato

## 🔎 Packet Capture Details
| **Protocol** | **Filter Used**  | **Observation** |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| **HTTP** | `tcp.port == 443` | Track malicious file downloads |
| **DNS**  | `dns`             | Used to Identify hostname resoltion|
| **dhcp** | `dhcp`            | Identify client machine details |

## 🚀 Summary
- IP address of infected Windows client : 10.1.17.215
- Mac address of the infected Windows client: 00:d0:b7:26:4a:74
- Host name of the infected Windows client:: DESKTOP-L8C5GSJ
- User account name: shutchenson
- Fake domain name: authenticator.org
- IP addresses used for C2 traffic: 5.252.153.241, 45.125.66.32, 45.125.66.252
 ## Conclusion
This analysis documents a security incident where a user downloaded malicious software while searching for Google Authenticator. 
The infection was confirmed through packet capture analysis, revealing communications between an internal host (10.1.17.215) and a suspicious external server (23.40.146.4) over HTTPS.
The affected system, identified by its Intel MAC address (00:d8:b7:26:4a:74), established encrypted communications on TCP port 443, consistent with known malvertising campaign patterns. 
This incident highlights the importance of ad security and verification of legitimate software sources, as well as the effectiveness of network monitoring in detecting potentially malicious activities.
