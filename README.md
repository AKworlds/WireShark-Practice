# 🖥️ Wireshark Practice

This repository contains hands-on exercises using **Wireshark** to analyze network traffic, detect anomalies, and understand cybersecurity threats. The goal is to strengthen skills in **network forensics, packet analysis, and security monitoring**.

## 📌 Objectives
- Capture and analyze network packets using **Wireshark**.
- Apply **filters** to investigate specific network activity.
- Identify **malicious traffic**, such as ARP spoofing, DNS poisoning, and unauthorized connections.
- Extract useful information from **PCAP files**.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools
- **Skills:** Packet Analysis, Network Forensics, Protocol Inspection  
- **Tools:** Wireshark, TCPDump, PCAP files

## 📝 Exercises Completed
Here are the **Wireshark exercises** I've completed with analysis:

1. **[Exercise 1: Basic Packet Capture](https://github.com/yourusername/wireshark-practice/exercise1.md)**
   - Capturing live traffic and using filters to analyze HTTP, DNS, and ICMP packets.
   
2. **[Exercise 2: Suspicious file downloaded](https://github.com/AKworlds/WireShark-Practice/blob/exercises/Exercise%202)**
   - Identifying what services were affected and how.

3. **[Exercise 3: DNS Traffic Analysis](https://github.com/yourusername/wireshark-practice/exercise3.md)**
   - Examining DNS queries for potential exfiltration techniques.

4. **[Exercise 4: HTTP and TLS Traffic Inspection](https://github.com/yourusername/wireshark-practice/exercise4.md)**
   - Differentiating between encrypted and unencrypted web traffic.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Download and Install Wireshark** from [Wireshark.org](https://www.wireshark.org/).
2. **Open a PCAP File**  
   - Load sample **PCAP files** from this repository or capture your own traffic.
3. **Apply Filters**  
   - Example:  
     - Show only HTTP traffic:  
       ```plaintext
       http
       ```
     - Show only DNS queries:  
       ```plaintext
       dns
       ```
4. **Analyze and Identify Threats**  
   - Look for **suspicious IP addresses**, **malformed packets**, and **unusual traffic patterns**.
